# Flutter Todo List App
This is a very basic app to handle creating a list of Todos.
It utilizes the [ListTile](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/material/ListTile-class.html)
widget for displaying individual Todo Items. It's specific to the MaterialApp
widget and won't work with the Cupertino App.

## Some Todos!
If you want to, you can clone this down and toy around with adding new features
that don't exist in the app yet. Here are some examples!

1. Allow the user to create multiple "lists" of Todos.
2. Add a "priority" value to Todos so a user can assign a priority value to each Todo
and then the list will sort those higher.
3. Allow the user to select an Icon to go with each item.
4. Move the Create Todo functionality to it's own route!

These are just some examples, but you can also do other crazier things if you want!
Maybe persist the Todos to a JSON file and save it to the user's device!
